# How to work with me?

## Introduction
Hi! I'm Pradeep Bishnoi - have spent nearly 15 years in the Software Industries across various start-ups (BitzerMobile, Lendingkart, Telio etc) and couple of enterprises (SAP, Oracle etc). I have spent good few years in almost every roles of Software Development Life Cycle and have worked towards delivering high quality products. Built many products from scratch and couple of them are main revenue generating stream at previous orgs. 

## Key Traits
- Integrity
- Discipline
- Very focused and hands-on Techie
- Love knowledge sharing and tech discussion to solve problem.
- Witty (that's what i was told in past)

## Engineering Practices

> Programming is not about typing, it's about thinking. - Rich Hickey
- Spend 80% time sharpening the Axe and 20% time to cut the wood efficiently. Think about the problem in detail before jumping into solution-ing it.
- Clean and Functional Code
- Prefer calculated move to Micro-Services and follow Event Driven Architecture
- Open to explore good/best practices which will help improve engineering productivity. Like UnitTests, TDD, Pair Programming, gitops, Automation etc
- Got Stuck in solving some problem? Before reaching out of help - make some rough notes on different approach you have tried and what was the outcome of those. That will save some duplicate effort and quick resolution while working together on it.

## Communication Style

- Transparent and Direct feedback mostly. I expect the same from individuals in team to be open about it. At times, i adjust according to individual behaviour and nature to positive/critical feedback.  
- Please read and follow [NoHello](https://pradeepbishnoi.github.io/nohello) as well
- Mostly upto date on reading my Email/Chat. Even FYI email as well. If anything need my attention/response, do tag me explicitly. 
- For urgent things or business critical issues, call my mobile as well (in case of delay in response on chat/email).
- Have some question bothering you during late night or early morning or any day, don't shy from posting a message about it. Will acknowledge or respond whenever i will be around.

## Zen At Work Philosophy
- Beautiful work is better than ugly work.
- Explicit communication is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex and Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat code is better than nested and sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts (code, documents, message).
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. Always reconfirm, instead of guess.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.


I will help you become the best. Will invest time, money and whatever it takes to help anyone in the team to be the best at what they do.Me cross questioning doesn't mean that something is wrong, it means i am more interested to understand the rationale behind it as well.Experimenting with Silent Meeting
Pretty self-motivated and always working towards improving myself. If you are like - we will make a good team and learn a lot from each other. 1 percent better everyday rule.Recommend Read:- Rework- Ikigai - Atomic Habits
