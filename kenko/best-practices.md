# Best Practices 
  - follow the boy-scout rule **Always leave the code better than you found it.**
  - while creating a slack group or project repo, don't prefix 'kenko' or 'kenko-engineering'.
  - all projects/group are within Kenko domain and we all are working towards that.
  - keep consise and meaning branch naming convention
  - remove the commented code while pushing the changes (code version control can help find what was commented and why)
  - Add comment TODO with your name, if something you want something to pick in near future to fix it.
